#'*Trips*
#' According to the documentation of the survey, the dataset with imputed trips
#' is the one that we should use (pag 102, "160216_Producto 4_Indicadores EODH.pdf")
#' The number of rows corresponds to what is mentioned in that same document.
#' Before importing this dataset I added a new column called "EMPTY" because values
#' didn't correspond to the label of the variable. By creating this empty label
#' everything makes more sense now. This file is now called:
#' "MOD_D_VIAJES_IMP_Modified.xlsx"
trips <- read_excel(paste0(route, "MOD_D_VIAJES_IMP_Modified.xlsx"))
trips <- trips[rowSums(is.na(trips)) != ncol(trips), ] # Removing files that only have NAs

#'*Personas*
#' In the original file the first row is the label of each variable and the
#' second row is the meaning of that label. I had to remove this second row and
#' delete some images that were inside the file to read it easily here in R.
#' This files is now called: MOD_B_PERSONAS_Modified.xlsx
#' When reading person there are some warnings related to people without age
person <- read_excel(paste0(route, "MOD_B_PERSONAS_Modified.xlsx"))
#hogar <- read_excel(paste0(route, "EOD_2017_DatosViajes.xlsx"), sheet = "DATOS HOGARES")

#'*Hierarchy main mode*
#' In this case I didn't have to import any hierarchy to define the main mode of
#' each trip because only P_E1_14_D have data for all rows, and only in P_E3_14_D
#' There were 773 rows with info (less than 2%). The remaining variables about
#' stages didn't have any information
#' However, I have to make the translation of these modes taking into account
#' the meaning of each number from Pag 3 "150508_EODH_TABLAS_AUX_V06.pdf"
